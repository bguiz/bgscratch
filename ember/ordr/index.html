        a partial is similar to an outlet, in that it designates where other templates may render within it;
        the main difference is that the same controller is used by the partial and the parent template that creates it
        its main utility is in splitting up larger more complex templates into smaller, more manageable ones
        note that the other reason why we use partials is because it can be reused

      Remember that the table resource is nested within the tables resource is the router - so the outlet here will render a table template
      When we go directly to the url #/tables/4, ember will load both the tables resource for this template (tables) and the table resource for the child template (table)
      Ember assumes that if resources are nested, you will want to display the data all the way up the present hierarchy
      this is the master detail patern
        - master shows the list of all models - shows a limited amount of info about each, serves as navigation
        - detail shows the info about a single model - shows all the information about the model
        - by keeping all data up the hierarchy in memory, ember supports this pattern well

        Similarly, if you update the URL, the current table is recoloured as it is active

              We do not need to load the data for this separately, because the table model
              already references a tab model.
              The render handlebar takes a first argument, a string that is the name of the
              template this is to be rendered,
              and a second argument, the variable of the model to pass to that template.

        this is a less verbose alternative to the below

                (data may be loaded asynchronously)
                Furthermore, we need to define the template such that changes to the model can be
                reflected in the rendered template when they are updated.
                So this is wrong: <img src="{{food.imageUrl}}" alt=""/>
                We use bindAttr to solve this problem. You can put any HTML attributes in them
                but the values for all of them must be strings which will be evaluated as a handlebars expression
