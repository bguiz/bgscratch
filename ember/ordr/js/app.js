// var App is a namespace to write all of our application code
var App = Ember.Application.create();
// namespace can be anything you like - but App is convention
// this single line boots ember, set up all controllers, views, and template rendering that is needed
// to see this, we'll actually need to render something - which we'll do in the HTML file
// note that this single line of code also generated the index route and controller, and renders it templates
// a single line of code does a lot
